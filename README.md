## Task 1 - OSI
OSI Model is a conceptual framework that describes the functioning of the network. 
The OSI model comprises of 7 layers including the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer.    
- **Switching:** Switching in IT and computer networking is the transfer of data packets, or blocks of data, through a network switch. Switches transfer data from source ports on devices such as computers to destination ports on devices such as routers.  
- **Routing:** Routing is the process of path selection in any network. A computer network is made of many machines, called nodes, and paths or links that connect those nodes. Communication between two nodes in an interconnected network can take place through many different paths.  
- **Handshakes:** It is protocal used to start a connection between two more devices.

## Task 2 - Serverless
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. 
Serverless computing is a cloud-computing model where developers focus on writing and deploying code without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. 
Despite its name, it doesn't mean servers are no longer involved; rather, the cloud provider handles all the server management tasks, including scaling, maintenance, and provisioning.
Serverless computing can simplify the process of deploying code into production.

## Task 3 - Sockets!
Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
Here users can join a chatroom to communicate in real time. 
Some examples of real-time applications are − 
- **Instant messengers** − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.
- **Push Notifications** − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly. 
- **Collaboration Applications** − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances. 
- **Online Gaming** − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.

## Task 4 - Make a Web app
A web app, is a program that runs in a web browser and is accessible over the internet. 
Web apps are stored on a remote server and can be accessed on any device with an active network connection.
This WebApp uses the following frameworks:
- Node.js and javascript: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
- Express.js: is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js.
- Mongoose: Mongoose  is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

## Task 5 - Docker
Docker is an operating system for containers. 
Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating system of a server. 
Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers.
A *container* is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.   
A *Docker image* is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains everything needed to run an application, including the operating system, application code, libraries, and dependencies.  
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up the environment, copies files into the image, installs dependencies, and specifies how the application should run.   
Work Flow:
Create a Dockerfile: You write a Dockerfile that describes how to build the image.  
Build the Image: Docker reads the Dockerfile and builds an image.  
Run the Container: You use the image to create and run a container.

## Task 6 - Docker file spyware
Spyware is software that can secretly record your activity on your computer. 
Most commonly, it is delivered through a free download or from an infected email attachment; this is known as a Trojan horse. 
A simple click is enough to install spyware on your computer without your knowledge.

## Task 7 - Webscraping and Automation
Selenium WebDriver is primarily designed to test web applications. 
You can perform functional Testing which is to test the functionality of web applications by automating user interactions such as
- clicking buttons
- filling out forms
- navigating pages
- verifying expected outcomes
   
This is an intsgram bot, that auto logs in, likes posts of followers, sends a 'I'm away' message when a message isnt replied with in 5 minutes.
