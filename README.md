## Task 1 - OSI
OSI Model is a conceptual framework that describes the functioning of the network. 
The OSI model comprises of 7 layers including the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer and application layer.    
- **Switching:** Switching in IT and computer networking is the transfer of data packets, or blocks of data, through a network switch. Switches transfer data from source ports on devices such as computers to destination ports on devices such as routers.  
- **Routing:** Routing is the process of path selection in any network. A computer network is made of many machines, called nodes, and paths or links that connect those nodes. Communication between two nodes in an interconnected network can take place through many different paths.  
- **Handshakes:** It is protocal used to start a connection between two more devices.

## Task 2 - Serverles



## Task 3 - Sockets!
Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
Here users can join a chatroom to communicate in real time. 
Some examples of real-time applications are − 
- **Instant messengers** − Chat apps like Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc. You need not refresh your app/website to receive new messages.
- **Push Notifications** − When someone tags you in a picture on Facebook, you receive a notification instantly. 
- **Collaboration Applications** − Apps like google docs, which allow multiple people to update same documents simultaneously and apply changes to all people's instances. 
- **Online Gaming** − Games like Counter Strike, Call of Duty, etc., are also some examples of real-time applications.

## Task 4 - Make a Web app
A web app, is a program that runs in a web browser and is accessible over the internet. 
Web apps are stored on a remote server and can be accessed on any device with an active network connection.
This WebApp uses the following frameworks:
- Node.js and javascript: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. 
- Express.js: is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js.
- Mongoose: Mongoose  is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

## Task 5 - Docker
Docker is an operating system for containers. 
Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating system of a server. 
Docker is installed on each server and provides simple commands you can use to build, start, or stop containers.
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Task 7 - Webscraping and Automation
Selenium WebDriver is primarily designed to test web applications. 
You can perform functional Testing which is to test the functionality of web applications by automating user interactions such as
- clicking buttons
- filling out forms
- navigating pages
- verifying expected outcomes
   
This is an intsgram bot, that auto logs in, likes posts of followers, sends a 'I'm away' message when a message isnt replied with in 5 minutes.
